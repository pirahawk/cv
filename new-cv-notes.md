### Derivco - Senior .NET Developer
https://derivco.com/
Ipswich (United Kingdom). 
2016 - present

Derivco is one of the largest multinational suppliers of online sports-betting and casino gaming technology. The Ipswich division is focused on the development of an online HTML5 sports-betting and casino lobby product that is used across the UK and European markets. Owing to its very early origins (7+ years), the client has been built using Script#, a translation layer which converts .NET OO constructs to javascript. The client architecture derives from the PureMVC framework in an effort to create loosely coupled UI, service and in-memory persistence layers, all of which communicate via an event-based broadcast notification pattern. During my time with the company I have worked with several different client teams, contributing to key product areas such as:

* Improving SEO rankings by pre-rendring and caching client data server-side during initial requests to which the client can bind to isomorphically.
* Improving site capacity during peak loads, via introducing a custom in-memory caching for redundant API calls and pausing API traffic upon detecting user-inactivity.
* Building proof-of concept Casino lobby implementations in collaboration with our development teams based overseas.
* Re-designing the client casino game launch pipeline to incorporate the ability to launch third party games in different formats (external/navigation, embedded, native etc)
* Adding client features to enable compliance with regional gambling legislation changes when rolling out to various markets.
* Improving developer experience by assisting all client teams with migrating our DVS from SVN to Git (hosted on Bitbucket).

### Xero - Senior .NET Developer
